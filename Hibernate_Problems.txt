Hibernate Framework: 

      1) Common check: 
                             
                            i) check Hibernate dependencie version.

                           ii) check mysql dependencie version.

                          iii) check database started or not.


      2) Step to crate Sample Hibernate Project: 
                       
                               i) Create Persistant class file
 
                              ii) Create Configuration file

                             iii) Create Session File

     3) 'test.player' doesn't exist (Table doesn't exit error) :

                             i) Goto Configuration file change the below statement

                                 Change: <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>

                                 To:         <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect</property> 
                                           
                                       (or) <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect</property>

     4) Unable to locate Persistance class: 

                           -> Please check your main file Persistance class name is correct (or) not.

     5) HQL operation table is not mapped problem:

                          -> HQL query statement not allowed table name because it's support database independent query language.

                          -> Query statement table name replace by Persistance class name.
 
                         From:    query = "from Player e where e.name = :name"             (Player is a TableName, :name is variable)

                            To:      query = "from Employee e where e.name= :name"       (Employee is Persistance Class Name)

     6) HCQL operation The method desc(String) is undefined for the type MysqlxCrud.Order:

                          From:   cr.addOrder(Order.desc("playerName"));

                          To:  c.addOrder(org.hibernate.criterion.Order.desc("playerName"));

     7) Unkown Entity:  (Reference = https://www.javatpoint.com/hibernate-table-per-hierarchy-using-annotation-                                                                                 tutorial-example)

                          -> Please once check full program step-by-step.

                         -> Check all class declare @Entity annotation.

                         -> Parent class only contains @Table(name) Annotation.
